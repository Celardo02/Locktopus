# Locktopus

_Locktopus_ is a cross platform password manager under development. It will run on:
- Linux;
- Windows; 
- Android. 

Any other platform will not be supported.

## Key Features 

Locktopus aims to be a very simple password manager that does not save any data on a remote server to maximize privacy. All information will be encrypted and stored locally on the device.  
However, it will always be possible to back up the encrypted password vault to the user's preferred backup system.  

Since no remote server is involved, synchronization between multiple devices is handled through peer-to-peer communication, which must be explicitly triggered by the user.
